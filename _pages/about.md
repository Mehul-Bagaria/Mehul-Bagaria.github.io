## About Me
Hello! Iâ€™m Mehul, a researcher turned founder, dedicated to empowering industries with innovative, custom-engineered solutions.

My journey began with a research project at [IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/), where I focused on multiphysics analysis. 

During my research tenure, I had the opportunity to work on projects sponsored by DRDO and ISRO, experiences that enriched my understanding of real-world engineering applications.

This journey has since evolved into a commitment to building solutions that integrate multi-domain engineering, from design and analysis to ML and IoT.

My goal is to develop custom engineering algorithms and hardware products through [Avkalan Labs](https://avkalanlabs.com/).

Alongside my team, I am also developing [Eigenplus](https://www.eigenplus.com/), an interactive learning platform. This platform aims to democratize advanced engineering knowledge by making complex concepts accessible to a broader audience, ultimately bridging the gap between theoretical research and practical industry applications.

## Unlocking the Infinite Potential of Metamaterials
My fascination with metamaterials has led me on an incredible journey. These materials, with their extraordinary properties engineered at the micro and nanoscale, have the power to reshape our world. The possibilities are boundless, from cloaking devices to next-gen optics, and I'm thrilled to share my insights and discoveries with you.

## Productivity: A Key to Success
In addition to my research, I firmly believe in the power of productivity. Time is our most precious resource, and I've spent years sharpening my skills to maximize efficiency without sacrificing quality. 

## The Gold Medal Journey
My academic journey took me to the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, where I earned the coveted [gold medal](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7140935957117145088/). It was at IIT Roorkee that I first dipped my toes into the world of nanomaterials, setting the stage for my future endeavours. The lessons learned and friendships forged during those formative years continue to inspire and drive me forward.

## Share and Grow
Knowledge is best when shared, and that's precisely why I've created this website. It's a space where we can engage, learn, and grow together. Feel free to explore [my blog](https://mehulbagaria.com/year-archive/), where I discuss everything from the concepts in metamaterials and computational engineering to practical tips for mastering productivity.

## Let's Connect
