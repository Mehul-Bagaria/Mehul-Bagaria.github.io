Every blog post that goes in internet has many points that make them great for any reader. The improving the ranking of the pages (blogs) on the google search is often a technical task involving many factors.

**Some of the key points that can often enhance your post outreach includes:**

- **Blog post topic:** Every great blog post begins with a topic that reader is searching for. It depends hugely on **what people want to know**, rather than what you want to write. There are multiple ways to find the trendy topic. You can go to course websites like Coursera, Udemy and see their **best selling courses** in particular category. Or you can check out e-commerce websites for best selling books in particular topic and check their index for the right topic.
- **Catchy Headline:** The next step is to find a catchy headline that gains the readers attentions and compel them to click on yours page link. As per the statistics long **headlines of around 15-17 words** often generate great CTR (Click Through Rate). Adding brackets {} & [] can also enhance the CTR.
- **Striking intro:** Whenever a reader clicks through any post, it is at the intro paragraph that he decides whether he will read the post or not. Ideally, it **acts as a hook** for the reader. You can either impose a **intriguing question** or through some **appealing data**, followed by **proof**, to gain the readers attention.
- **Incredible post:** An ideal post keeps the user engaged throughout the post. Structured post with **proper sub-headings**, font size of **16-20** and **lots of visuals** psychologically keeps the user engaged in the post. Overall word count of the post **1000-2000** produces good outreach.
