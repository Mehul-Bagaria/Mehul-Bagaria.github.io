LS-DYNA can be a great software when doing the explicit analysis or the analysis that happen in fraction of a seconds. These type of analysis involve high impact rate or high strain rate.

**There are few basic steps that are common in all the dynamic analysis :**

* Creating the **geometry**

* Defining the **material**

* Assigning the values of **materials** and **sections** to the **parts** of geometry.

* Assigning the **boundary conditions** and **loading**

* Defining the type or nature of the **contact**

* Defining the **termination** time
