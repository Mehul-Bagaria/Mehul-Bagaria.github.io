But, very often, you can fall into the trap of shifting from actual work to random web surfing.

A great solution to that problem is a floating stopwatch. That, you can turn on when you are working. So, by the end of the day you will have a more accurate idea about your productivity. 

The default app of windows doesn't provide functionality of a floating stopwatch.

Of the many options that i checked, the [free-stopwatch](https://free-stopwatch.com/) seemed to be a good software for windows.

You can customize the size and theme. And, you can also export the data to `.txt` file.
