*Mechanical Engineering* ‚öôÔ∏è | *Nanotechnology* üî¨ | *Blogging* üíª

I am a Mechanical Engineering graduate with enthusiasm for thermodynamics and mechanics of materials. And I have done my master's in Nanotechnology from IIT Roorkee. I know computational mechanics ranging from Molecular Dynamics to Finite Element Analysis.

I am working on *Topology Optimization (TO)* under different physics, including *thermal* and *electromagnetic radiation.* The thermal TO techniques are utilized to enhance the heat transfer rate, and the optimization techniques are implemented in electromagnetism to alter the wave propagation within the multi-layered structures.

## Research Interest
My interests include metamaterials, nanomaterials, thermal engineering, energy harvesting and storage systems, and optimization techniques.
