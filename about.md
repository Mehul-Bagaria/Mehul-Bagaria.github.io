I am working on *Topology Optimization (TO)* under different physics, including *thermal* and *electromagnetic radiation.* The thermal TO techniques are utilized to enhance the heat transfer rate, and the optimization techniques are implemented in electromagnetism to alter the wave propagation within the multi-layered structures.

My interests include metamaterials, nanomaterials, thermal engineering, energy harvesting and storage systems, and optimization techniques.
