This project delves into the innovative field of metamaterials, exploring their potential for achieving thermal infrared (IR) stealth capabilities. Metamaterials are engineered materials known for their unique properties, and in this study, we investigate how variations in material configurations and structural designs impact their thermal stealth performance. The project is divided into two key modules: the analysis of different material configurations' effects on emission properties, followed by the evaluation of structural variations while keeping the material configuration constant.

## Highlights
* **Metamaterials for Thermal IR Stealth:** Metamaterials have garnered attention for their potential in achieving thermal IR stealth, making them a key focus of this project. These materials have the ability to manipulate thermal radiation in ways that can render objects invisible to IR detection.

* **Material Configuration Analysis:** The project considers five distinct material configurations, including combinations of metals and dielectrics. The metamaterial unit cell consists of three layers, each with specific properties, offering a versatile platform for analysis.

* **Finite Element Method (FEM) Analysis:** Cutting-edge full-wave numerical analysis is conducted using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6. This numerical approach enables a detailed investigation of the metamaterial's thermal properties.

* **Mesh Size Considerations:** The project pays careful attention to mesh size during FEM analysis, ensuring that the maximum element size is restricted to λ/5, where λ represents the wavelength of the incident light. This meticulous approach contributes to reliable simulation results.

* **Material and Structure Configuration Scenarios:** To comprehensively assess the metamaterial's performance, various scenarios are explored, including different material configurations (metals and dielectrics) and structural variations (e.g., triangular and circular arrays). This extensive analysis provides insights into the interplay between material and structure.

* **Emissivity and Radiative Cooling:** Emissivity, a key parameter in thermal radiation, is analyzed for different material and structural configurations. The project explores how metamaterials can selectively emit radiation in specific spectral ranges while remaining stealthy in others. Radiative cooling effects are also investigated, showcasing the potential for thermal stability and stealth.

* **Comparison with Single Materials:** The project compares the performance of metamaterials with single-material coatings, demonstrating the advantages of metamaterials in achieving radiative cooling and stealth capabilities.

* **Perfect IR Stealth Potential:** By achieving emission in undetectable ranges and minimal emission in detectable ranges, metamaterials demonstrate their potential for perfect IR stealth, making them promising candidates for applications requiring thermal invisibility.
