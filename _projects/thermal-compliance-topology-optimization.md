In this project, we explore the application of Thermal Compliance Topology Optimization (TO) in the design of geothermal heat exchangers (GHE) for high-temperature conditions. The goal is to create highly efficient GHE systems that maximize heat transfer and minimize thermal compliance while adhering to volume constraints. This innovative approach leverages cutting-edge numerical analysis techniques and open-source software tools to optimize the layout of underground tubes in GHE systems, enhancing their performance in heating and cooling applications.

## Highlights

- **Thermal Compliance Topology Optimization:** The project centres on the novel concept of Thermal Compliance Topology Optimization, which aims to minimize thermal compliance within specified volume constraints. This optimization technique is crucial for designing GHE systems capable of withstanding high-temperature conditions efficiently.

- **Utilization of Finite Element Analysis:** We employ the open-source finite element analysis software FEniCS, known for its flexibility in coding optimizations for various multi-physics problems. This software enables us to discretize the physical domain using a finite element mesh, providing a robust foundation for our thermal compliance optimization.

- **Visualization with ParaView:** The results obtained from the optimization process are visualized using ParaView, an open-source visualization tool. This allows for a comprehensive examination of the optimized GHE structures, aiding in evaluating and comparing their performance.

- **Diverse Thermal Loading Conditions:** To ensure the adaptability of the optimized GHE designs, we consider four distinct thermal loading conditions, each with different boundary conditions. This comprehensive approach ensures that our solutions can be applied in a wide range of real-world scenarios.

- **Parametric Studies:** The project conducts detailed parametric studies to investigate factors such as mesh refinement and filter radius influence the optimized results. These studies help us fine-tune our optimization process for maximum efficiency.

- **Optimized GHE Design:** The project's final output is the generation of optimized GHE structures. These structures resemble plant roots and are strategically designed to maximize heat transfer, with the heat sink acting as a point of thermal energy absorption.

- **Enhanced Heat Dissipation:** By implementing the optimized GHE designs, we aim to achieve superior heat dissipation and an extended influence range compared to conventional serpentine layouts. This improved performance contributes to energy efficiency and environmental sustainability.

- **Reduced Soil Temperature Impact:** The optimized GHE layouts result in lower overall soil temperatures, minimizing the impact of heat accumulation near the tubes. This ensures the efficient operation of the GHE system over extended periods.
